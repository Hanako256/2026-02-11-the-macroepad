# The Macroepad
The Macroepad is a macropad with 6 keys, 3 poe drawings on the PCB, and very intentional spelling. It is my first ever hardware project.

I don't even know how many times I redesigned this part...from just changing the wiring to restarting from scratch, it must have gone through over 7 versions by now, but I'm finally happy with this.

2 of those poes will never see the light of day...oh well, sacrifices must be made.


## Case
<img width="937" height="1150" alt="Macroepad Case" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b54f318-0a11-435d-9814-aeee57fc3f35" />

Made in Onshape. As a result of the pcb redesigning, this case has also been redesigned and re-exported far too many times.


## Firmware
The Macroepad uses KMK firmware. 4 of the 6 keys are directional inputs (like arrow keys on a regular keyboard), the other 2 are for Right Click and Enter.
